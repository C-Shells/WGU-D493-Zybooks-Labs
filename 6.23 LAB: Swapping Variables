#NOTE!!!!  Currently this code is producing the desired output but the auto grader is saying my output doesn't return 4 values, when it clearly does...
#I'm looking into why this would be occuring.  Swapping the values is accurately happening.  4 values are being returned, but I get this error.

#E.G.  "Your output:  10 -1 -6 4
#Error "swap_values(-1, 10, 4, -6) did not return four values.
#Your function may be missing a return statement or 
#returned an incorrect amount of values."

#I have tried adding the input values as shown below when calling the function
#as well as writing the separate user_val() values as separate input statements thinking maybe the autograder would want it that way.  Neither will pass.


# Define your function here.
def swap_values(user_val1, user_val2, user_val3, user_val4):
    hold_value = user_val1
    user_val1 = user_val2
    user_val2 = hold_value
    hold_value = user_val3
    user_val3 = user_val4
    user_val4 = hold_value
   # user_value_list = [user_val1, user_val2, user_val3, user_val4]
    return print(f'{user_val1} {user_val2} {user_val3} {user_val4}')
    

if __name__ == '__main__': 
    # Type your code here. Your code must call the function.
    swap_values(int(input()), int(input()), int(input()), int(input()))
