These are my solutions to the zyBooks labs for D493:  Scripting and Programming
I'm adding them here because 
1) The Labs can be so frustrating when you get stuck and there are no hints or anything to help you get back on track.  Then you spend hours researching and can eventually end up feeling so frustrated and/or demoralized that you question whether you will ever understand or learn the concepts.  These are not meant for you to copy/paste into your lab, just use them to get an idea of how to get back on track and past where you are stuck.

2) To keep a record of my solutions for easy reference.
