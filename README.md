These are my solutions to the zyBooks labs for WGU D493:  Scripting and Programming
I'm adding them here because 
1) The Labs are so frustrating when you are trying to learn online and get stuck because they throw in something that wasn't really included in the lesson and there are no hints or anything to help you get back on track.  It's usually some small question that would take 30 seconds to figure out if you had a hint, but you don't, and it will be a week before you can get an appointment with the instructor (if they'll help you at all - I have literally been told "You should already know that.  Go back and figure it out.").  So you spend hours researching and eventually end up feeling so frustrated and/or demoralized that you question whether you will ever understand or learn the concepts.  These are not meant for you to copy/paste into your lab, just use them to get an idea of how someone else solved it so you get back on track and past where you are stuck with your own code.  My code is probably rudimentary, but I'm OK with that.

2) To keep a record of my solutions for easy reference when I get to another lab and can't remember how I did that before.
